        *  As more elements are received, elements older than the specified duration are taken from the queue and produced on the
        *  result sequence. This causes elements to be delayed with duration.

        * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler]  Scheduler to run the timer on. If not specified, defaults to Rx.Scheduler.timeout
        * @returns {Observable} An observable sequence with the elements skipped during the specified duration from the end of the source sequence.
